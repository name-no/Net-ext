=head1 NAME

Net::UNIX::Server - UNIX-domain sockets interface module for listeners

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Gen;		# optional
    use Net::UNIX;		# optional
    use Net::UNIX::Server;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Net::UNIX::Server> module provides additional
services for UNIX-domain socket
communication.  It is layered atop the
L<C<Net::UNIX>|Net::UNIX>
and
L<C<Net::Gen>|Net::Gen>
modules,
which are part of the same distribution.

=head2 Public Methods

The following methods are provided by the C<Net::UNIX::Server> module
itself, rather than just being inherited from
L<C<Net::UNIX>|Net::UNIX>
or
L<C<Net::Gen>|Net::Gen>.

=over 4

=item new

Usage:

    $obj = new Net::UNIX::Server;
    $obj = new Net::UNIX::Server $pathname;
    $obj = new Net::UNIX::Server $pathname, \%parameters;
    $obj = 'Net::UNIX::Server'->new();
    $obj = 'Net::UNIX::Server'->new($pathname);
    $obj = 'Net::UNIX::Server'->new($pathname, \%parameters);

Returns a newly-initialised object of the given class.  This is
much like the regular C<new> methods of other modules in this
distribution, except that it does a
C<bind> rather than a C<connect>, and it does a C<listen>.  Unless
specified otherwise with a C<type> object parameter, the underlying
socket will be a datagram socket (C<SOCK_DGRAM>).

The examples above show the indirect object syntax which many prefer,
as well as the guaranteed-to-be-safe static method call.  There
are occasional problems with the indirect object syntax, which
tend to be rather obscure when encountered.  See
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1998-01/msg01674.html
for details.

See L<Net::TCP::Server> for an example of running a server.  The
differences are only in the module names and the fact that UNIX-domain
sockets bind to a pathname rather than to a port number.  Of course,
that example is for stream (C<type = SOCK_STREAM>) sockets rather than
for datagrams.  UNIX-domain datagram sockets don't need to do an
accept() (and can't where I've tested this code), and can't answer back
to their clients unless those clients have also bound to a specific path
name.

=item init

Usage:

    return undef unless $self = $self->init;
    return undef unless $self = $self->init(\%parameters);
    return undef unless $self = $self->init($pathname);
    return undef unless $self = $self->init($pathname, \%parameters);

Verifies that all previous parameter assignments are valid (via
C<checkparams>).  Returns the incoming object on success, and
C<undef> on failure.  Usually called only via a derived class's
C<init> method or its own C<new> call.

=head2 Protected Methods

[See the description in L<Net::Gen/"Protected Methods"> for my
definition of protected methods in Perl.]

None.

=head2 Known Socket Options

There are no socket options known to the C<Net::UNIX::Server> module itself.

=head2 Known Object Parameters

There are no object parameters registered by the C<Net::UNIX::Server> module
itself.

=head2 Exports

=item default

None.

=item exportable

None.

=item tags

The following I<:tags> are available for grouping exportable items:

=over 6

=item :ALL

All of the above exportable items.

=head1 THREADING STATUS

This module has been tested with threaded perls, and should be as thread-safe
as perl itself.  (As of 5.005_03 and 5.005_57, that's not all that safe
just yet.)  It also works with interpreter-based threads ('ithreads') in
more recent perl releases.
